# SonnyStream
'Twitter'-like app that uses Parse as a backend. 

This project was created to learn Parse as a backend in an iOS application. Parse, as it was when it was developed, no longer exists. It instead exists as a backend package that users can host themselves.

This project is no longer being maintained. (6/8/17)
